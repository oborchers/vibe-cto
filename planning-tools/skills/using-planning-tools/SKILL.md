description: "This skill should be used when the user invokes any /plan-* command from the planning-tools plugin (/plan-context, /plan-master, /plan-open-questions, /plan-verify, /plan-tick, /plan-progress, /plan-delete), asks how Claude Code's plan files work, asks where plans are stored, asks to author or audit a multi-phase master planning document, asks how to walk through open questions interactively (from a plan, a scope report, or the conversation itself), asks how to write progress entries, or mentions ~/.claude/plans/ or .claude/planning-tools.local.md. Provides the index of planning-tools commands, the master-plan workflow lifecycle, the v0.3.0+ list-shape mandate (phases and questions as headings + bulleted scope items, never tables), the v0.3.2+ plain-bullet shape (no `- [ ]` checkboxes — heading emoji is the sole tick signal), the v0.8.0 plain-language rule for chat output plus the ID + name rule for every external reference, the progress-entry methodology, and the mechanics of Claude Code's plan-mode file storage."

# Planning Tools

This plugin provides two complementary workflows on top of Claude Code's plan mode:

1. **Per-session plan-file management** — Claude Code stores each session's plan at `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md`. The plugin's `/planning-tools:plan-delete` command cleans these up.
2. **Master-plan authoring** — long, multi-phase planning documents that live in the user's project (e.g., `context/tickets/`, `docs/plans/`) and decompose work into actionable phases. The plugin's `/planning-tools:plan-context`, `/planning-tools:plan-master`, and `/planning-tools:plan-verify` commands cover this lifecycle.

## How to Access Skills

Use the `Skill` tool to invoke any skill by name. When invoked, follow the skill's guidance directly.

## Commands

| Command | Triggers On |
|---------|-------------|
| `/planning-tools:plan-context [topic] [--domains a,b,c]` | Pre-loading context for a future master plan. Stage 1 Triage proposes domains, Stage 2 Confirm prints them as text + asks a **binary** `AskUserQuestion` (Proceed / Cancel — never multi-select, since the 4-option cap would crash on common N≥5), Stage 3 dispatches parallel `plan-context-worker` agents (one per domain), Stage 4 verifies findings with direct Reads. Emits a scope report. NO plan file written. |
| `/planning-tools:plan-master <topic> [--context <path>] [--domains a,b,c]` | Drafting a multi-phase master plan. Reuses a prior `/planning-tools:plan-context` report if `--context` is supplied; otherwise runs the same Triage + Confirm + Explore + Verify pre-flight (Stage 2 uses the same binary-confirm pattern). Then dispatches `plan-master-architect` (opus) to synthesize. Writes to a project-local path (`context/tickets/`, `docs/plans/`, or `.claude/plans/master/`). |
| `/planning-tools:plan-open-questions [path] [question-number]` | Walking through open questions interactively — **from any source**, not just a master plan. Resolves the source via a 4-rung ladder: (1) explicit path, (2) whatever is already in this conversation (a plan read earlier, a `/plan-context` scope report, worker findings, or questions the user typed), (3) branch-matched master plan (only when a git repo exists — skipped silently otherwise), (4) `AskUserQuestion` fallback (`Point me at a file` / `I'll paste the questions` / `Cancel`). **Never hard-fails.** Parses four question shapes (v0.3.0 `- **Q<N> — …:**` bullets, legacy v0.2.x table, scope-report bullets, free-form conversation lists — the last two auto-numbered `Q1..QN`). Per question the main conversation reads up to ~5 cited anchors and prints a **fixed** block: `## Q<N>` → **Why it matters** (1–3 short sentences) → **Where it matters** (concrete anchors, or an honest "Not tied to a specific file yet") → optional one-line **If we get this wrong** → 2–4 options with one Recommended and Defer always last. Then one `AskUserQuestion` per question, never batched. Apply is **source-aware**: a `plan-file` source gets the 3-option gate (Apply / Show me the diff first / Discard) and moves answered questions from `## Open Questions` to `## Resolved Questions`; `report-file` and `conversation` sources get a printed summary and **no write, no gate**. Runs entirely in the main conversation — no subagent dispatch. |
| `/planning-tools:plan-verify [path]` | Auditing a drafted master plan. If no path is supplied, globs candidates and uses binary-confirm (Proceed with most-recent / Cancel) to pick. Dispatches `plan-verifier` agent against the `plan-verification-checklist` skill. Emits Critical/Important/Suggestion findings with a PASS/FAIL verdict. On PASS, optionally appends a `- **Verified:** YYYY-MM-DD` bullet to the plan's context block (a `> **Verified:**` line on legacy blockquote plans). |
| `/planning-tools:plan-tick [phase] [path]` | Auto-ticking provenly-achieved phases in a master plan. **Default (no args):** detects the current branch, resolves the master plan that matches it, runs the audit inline in the main conversation (file existence + branch diff membership + symbol presence), ticks all phases verdicted `ACHIEVED`. **Manual override** `/planning-tools:plan-tick <phase>`: ticks one phase without audit. Both modes are non-interactive — never asks. No subagent dispatched. Works only on plans conforming to `planning-tools:master-plan-methodology` v0.2.1+. |
| `/planning-tools:plan-progress [--final] [--destination <type>:<id>] [--style-from <path>] [--ticket <id>]` | Synthesizing a single dense progress entry for the current branch and applying it at the configured destination (markdown file / Linear comment / GitHub issue/PR comment). Reuses plan-tick's branch + plan resolution. SHA-based idempotency: safe to re-run between phases. Three-way detection on the existing entry: new / in-flight update / completed (3-option refresh prompt). First-run destination selection persists to `.claude/planning-tools.local.md`. `--final` flips to shipped state with `**Shipped <date> via PR #<N>.**` + `✅` heading. Composition runs inline in the main conversation — no subagent dispatched. Style spec, sub-markers, and adapter contracts in `planning-tools:progress-methodology`. |
| `/planning-tools:plan-delete` | Clearing the current session's plan file at `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md`. Detects the slug via `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` + transcript grep, deletes the file, recreates empty, re-reads. Bootstraps with `EnterPlanMode` → no-op plan → `ExitPlanMode` if the session has never entered plan mode. |

## Ticket-aware planning

`/planning-tools:plan-master` and `/planning-tools:plan-context` accept a ticket URL or ID as their first argument. When matched (Linear `[A-Z]{2,6}-\d+` or `https://linear.app/...`; GitHub `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>` or `<owner>/<repo>#<N>`), the plugin fetches the ticket via the source adapter — title, body, and **all comments, no cap** — and propagates the block to Stage 1 Triage + every Stage 3 worker + the architect. The architect emits a `- **Ticket:** <url>` bullet as the first context bullet. Free-text topics still work — on no pattern match, existing behavior is preserved. See `planning-tools:progress-methodology` for the adapter contract.

## Supporting Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `planning-tools:master-plan-methodology` | Codifies the master-plan template: universal core sections, trigger-based optional sections, integer-only phase rule, Open Questions at top, status emoji convention, evidence attribution, callouts, cross-references. Read this before authoring or reviewing any master plan. |
| `planning-tools:plan-verification-checklist` | Single owner of the audit dimensions used by `/planning-tools:plan-verify` and the `plan-verifier` agent. Defines severity (Critical/Important/Suggestion) and the PASS/FAIL verdict rule. |
| `planning-tools:plain-language` | Single owner of two rules. **(1) Plain language for chat output** — everything a `/plan-*` command prints into the conversation, written for a reader skimming with low concentration: one idea per sentence, short sentences, everyday words, the point first, each block standing alone. Explicitly does **not** apply to the body of a master plan (which stays detailed) or to progress entries posted to Linear / GitHub (which keep the dense style). **(2) ID + name** — every ticket, ADR, and PR carries its human name alongside its ID (`CI-21 — Add keyboard navigation`), everywhere including inside plan documents; `CI-21 — (title unavailable)` when the title cannot be fetched. `/planning-tools:plan-verify` audits rule 2 as a Suggestion only. |
| `planning-tools:progress-methodology` | Single owner of the progress-entry style (dense paragraph), sub-marker convention (`Piggybacked:` / `Verification:` / `Out of scope:` / `Shipped`), entry-key marker format, SHA-tracking idempotency algorithm, three-way detection rule, comment-fetch policy (all comments, no cap), and the source + destination adapter contracts (markdown / Linear / GitHub). Read this when running or maintaining `/planning-tools:plan-progress`. |

## How Per-Session Plan File Detection Works

For `/planning-tools:plan-delete`: Claude Code stamps every transcript entry with a top-level `"slug"` field once plan mode is entered. That slug equals the plan filename (without `.md`). This is the authoritative source:

1. Read `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` from the environment (the current session's UUID).
2. Compute the transcript path: `$HOME/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.jsonl`
   - The encoded CWD replaces both `/` and `.` with `-` (e.g., `/Users/o/Code.nosync/x` becomes `-Users-o-Code-nosync-x`).
3. Extract the slug: `grep -m1 -o '"slug":"[^"]*"' <transcript> | sed 's/"slug":"//; s/"$//'`
4. The plan file is `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md`.

If the grep returns empty, the session has not entered plan mode yet — bootstrap with `EnterPlanMode` → minimal no-op plan → `ExitPlanMode`, then re-extract.

**Why not "most recently modified file in ~/.claude/plans/"?** Parallel sessions in other terminals/projects write to their own slugs concurrently. mtime is unreliable.

**Why not grep the transcript for `~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md` paths?** That matches any plan path mentioned in conversation (e.g., `ls` output), not just the session's true plan slug. The `"slug"` field is set by Claude Code itself and is unambiguous.

## Why This Plugin Exists

- **Per-session plan files persist by design** — they live outside the context window and survive compaction so they can be re-loaded. The downside: stale content accumulates in the slug file across re-plans, and after compaction Claude often loses awareness of the path. `/planning-tools:plan-delete` solves both.
- **Master plans are a different artifact** — they live in the project (git-versioned), describe a topic in depth across multiple phases, and act as the source of truth for execution. The plugin codifies how they are authored (`/planning-tools:plan-context`, `/planning-tools:plan-master`) and audited (`/planning-tools:plan-verify`), with a strict format-driven methodology so plans are predictable and machine-checkable.

## Conventions That Apply Everywhere

- **Integer phase numbering only** — phases are `1, 2, 3, …`. No decimals, no letter suffixes, no sub-phases. The word "Phase" is reserved for integer-numbered work units inside a master plan.
- **List shape for phases and questions (v0.3.0+, plain bullets v0.3.2+)** — Implementation Phases is a series of `### Phase <N>: <name> <emoji>` H3 headings with `- ` bulleted scope items underneath (plain bullets canonical in v0.3.2+; legacy `- [ ]` / `- [x]` shapes parse silently with no finding). The phase heading emoji is the sole tick signal — per-bullet checkbox state is no longer tracked. Open Questions and Resolved Questions are bulleted `- **Q<N> — <question>:** ...` lines. **No markdown tables for any of these three sections.** `/planning-tools:plan-tick` supports the legacy v0.2.x table shape during a transition window.
- **Per-phase TL;DR (v0.3.1+)** — each phase has a `**TL;DR:**` callout under its heading capturing what the phase does and why, 1–3 sentences. Tooling ignores the line; readers get a glance-able digest. Missing TL;DR = Important finding from `/planning-tools:plan-verify`.
- **No sizing estimates** — phases describe scope, not effort. No XS/S/M/L, no time estimates.
- **Open Questions at the top** — blocking questions appear immediately after the context block, not at the end of the plan.
- **Project-agnostic** — the plugin does not assume any ticket-prefix convention. The architect picks optional sections based on what the work touches, not from a classifier.
- **AskUserQuestion is owned by the main conversation** — never by subagents. The plugin's commands handle all user decision points; agents only fetch, synthesize, or audit.
- **Plain language in chat, detail in documents (v0.8.0+)** — everything a command prints into the conversation is written for a reader skimming with low concentration: one idea per sentence, short sentences, the point first. The master plan `.md` itself stays detailed and citation-heavy, and progress entries posted to Linear / GitHub keep their dense style. Owner: `planning-tools:plain-language`.
- **Every external reference carries its name (v0.8.0+)** — `CI-21 — Add keyboard navigation`, `ADR-28: Session error taxonomy`, `PR #412 — Fix locale fallback`. Never a bare ID; write `CI-21 — (title unavailable)` when the title cannot be fetched. Applies in chat **and** inside plan documents. `/planning-tools:plan-verify` flags violations as a Suggestion — it never blocks a PASS.
