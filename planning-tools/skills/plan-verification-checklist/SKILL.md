# Plan Verification Checklist

This skill codifies the audit performed by `/planning-tools:plan-verify` and the `plan-verifier` agent. It is the single owner of the checklist; the command and agent both reference it rather than duplicating rules.

The checklist applies to any master plan written under the `master-plan-methodology` skill. Findings are graded **Critical**, **Important**, or **Suggestion**.

## Severity guide

- **Critical** — the plan cannot be safely executed as written. Phase numbering violates the integer-only rule; required universal-core sections are missing; phases have no actionable scope (no file paths, no exit criteria); cited sources do not exist.
- **Important** — the plan can be executed but has gaps that will cause friction. Trigger-based optional sections are missing despite the work clearly touching that area (e.g., schema changes with no Rollback section); dependency notation is vague; Open Questions appear at the bottom instead of after the context block.
- **Suggestion** — the plan would benefit from polish. Bold-prefix callouts not used where they would help; cross-references use absolute paths instead of relative; status emoji inconsistent.

## Audit dimensions

### 1. Universal-core completeness

Verify every required section is present and in the prescribed order:

- [ ] **Title** (H1) with one-line synopsis
- [ ] **Plan-level TL;DR (v0.3.3+):** the **first non-blank line under the H1** starts with `**TL;DR:**` and contains 2–4 sentences (what the plan does + why). Missing or empty = **Important** (readability gap, not Critical; PASS still reachable). Mirrors the per-phase TL;DR rule.
- [ ] **Context block** — a bulleted metadata list (`- **Ticket(s):** …`, `- **PRD / Source:** …`, `- **Evidence:** …`, `- **Depends on:** …`, `- **Constraints:** …`, optional leading `- **Ticket:** <url>`) immediately under the TL;DR. **Legacy `>` blockquote context blocks (pre-v0.3.3) are accepted silently — no finding either way.**
- [ ] **Open Questions** section as an **unordered list** (no table), located **immediately after the context block** (Critical finding if at the bottom)
- [ ] **Resolved Questions** section as an **unordered list** (may be empty; no table)
- [ ] **Implementation Phases** section with `### Phase <N>: <name> <emoji>` H3 headings and `- ` bulleted scope items (no table; v0.3.2+ canonical shape is plain bullets, legacy `- [ ]`/`- [x]` accepted silently)
- [ ] **Design Principles** numbered list
- [ ] **What's NOT in <TOPIC> (and why)** section

Missing universal-core sections = **Critical**.

### 2. Section-coverage gaps (trigger-based)

For each trigger observed in the plan, check the corresponding optional section is present:

| If the plan mentions | Then it must include |
|---|---|
| SQL, schema changes, migrations, new tables/columns | **Data Model** / **Schema** AND **Rollback Procedure** |
| React components, UI changes, new screens/dialogs | **Component Architecture**, **UI States** or **Skeleton Screens**, **Manual QA Checklist** |
| Novel UI surfaces | **Visual Design — ASCII Mockups** |
| Multiple locales | **i18n** table |
| New analytics events or tracking | **Analytics** section |
| Cost-bearing infrastructure (e.g., cloud spend) | **Cost Summary** |
| Failure modes, dependencies, external risks | **Risks + Mitigations** |
| Manual deploy steps or post-merge ops | **Deployment Steps** |
| Production validation requirements | **Verification (post-merge / post-deploy)** |
| Production incident remediation | **Recovery for Affected Records** |
| File-level impact across phases | **Code Changes (file × phase)** |
| ≥5 design decisions referenced | **Design Decisions** table |
| Tests required for any phase | **Tests** breakdown |
| External prerequisites (other tickets) | **Prerequisites** |

Missing trigger-driven section = **Important**.

### 3. Phase actionability (v0.3.0 list shape, v0.3.1 TL;DR, v0.3.2 plain bullets)

Every phase must be one `### Phase <N>: <verb-led name> <emoji>` H3 heading followed by a `**TL;DR:**` callout and a plain unordered bulleted list of scope items. Each phase block must contain:

- [ ] An H3 heading of the exact shape `### Phase <N>: <verb-led name> <emoji>` where `<N>` is a positive integer and `<emoji>` is one of `⏳ 🚧 ✅ ❌` and is the last token on the line
- [ ] **Per-phase TL;DR (v0.3.1+):** the **first non-blank line under the heading** must start with `**TL;DR:**` and contain 1–3 sentences capturing what the phase does and why. Missing or empty TL;DR = **Important**. Existing v0.3.0 plans without TL;DRs are flagged Important but not Critical — the rest of the audit still proceeds and PASS verdict is still reachable if no other Critical findings exist.
- [ ] At least one `- ` scope item with a concrete **file path** or named symbol (when the work touches code). Legacy `- [ ]` / `- [x]` shapes are accepted silently — no finding either way for v0.3.2+ plans.
- [ ] A bolded `**Exit criteria:** …` scope item describing definition of done
- [ ] A bolded `**Tests:** …` scope item when the phase requires tests (omit when no tests are needed)

Phases with vague scope ("update the UI", "improve performance") = **Critical**. Phases missing exit criteria = **Critical**. Phases missing any `- ` scope item at all = **Critical**. Phases missing TL;DR = **Important** (not Critical).

### 4. Integer phase numbering (non-negotiable)

Scan every "Phase" reference in the document:

- [ ] All phase numbers are positive integers (`1, 2, 3, …`)
- [ ] No decimals (`0.5`, `1.5`)
- [ ] No letter suffixes (`1A`, `2B`)
- [ ] No letter-only phases (`Phase A`, `Phase B`)
- [ ] No ranges (`Phase 0–5`)
- [ ] No `Sub-Phases` or `Implementation Sub-Phases` heading

Any violation = **Critical**.

### 5. Dependency traceability

The context block's `Depends on:` line, plus any inline `Depends on` references, must specify **the artifact** that creates the dependency, not just the ticket:

- ✅ `Depends on: CI-22 (src/features/cases/lib/sf-links.ts helpers + i18n key + ADR-28 amendment)`
- ❌ `Depends on: CI-22`

Vague dependencies = **Important**.

### 6. Citation resolution

Every evidence claim must be traceable:

- [ ] Transcripts cite **speaker + env + date + ticket + case-ref + verbatim quote**
- [ ] ADR references use `ADR-NN` or full path
- [ ] Code references use `<repo-relative-path>:<line>`
- [ ] Research docs use relative paths (no broken links)

Unresolvable or vague citations = **Important**. Fabricated citations (linked source does not exist) = **Critical**.

### 7. Callout / evidence convention compliance

Bold-prefix callouts must use the prescribed labels:

- [ ] `**Decision:** …` for settled choices
- [ ] `**Rationale:** …` for reasoning
- [ ] `**Risk:** …` for known risks
- [ ] `**Mitigation:** …` for risk responses
- [ ] `**Note:** …` for informational asides

Blockquotes (`>`) are used **only** for invariants/constraints. The top-of-file context block is **not** a blockquote (v0.3.3+: plan-level `**TL;DR:**` + bullets); legacy blockquote context blocks are accepted silently. GitHub-style `> [!NOTE]` admonitions are not used.

Misused callout labels = **Suggestion**.

### 8. Open Questions placement

- [ ] **Open Questions** appears immediately after the context block (i.e., before Implementation Phases)
- [ ] The section is **not** at the bottom of the document

If Open Questions is at the bottom = **Important**.

### 9. No sizing estimates

- [ ] No XS/S/M/L, T-shirt sizes, or time estimates anywhere in the plan
- [ ] No `**Size:**` or `**Effort:**` bolded scope items in any phase

Sizing present = **Important** (will be deleted on next revision).

### 10. One PR per master plan

Scan every phase scope and every section other than `Release`:

- [ ] No `gh pr create` instructions inside a phase
- [ ] No "Open PR" / "Merge PR" / "Request review" instructions inside a phase
- [ ] No "Reviewer can sign off after this phase" or similar per-phase PR handoff
- [ ] No per-phase merges to `main`, `master`, or `develop`

Per-phase `git commit` and `git push` to the working branch are **allowed** — do not flag them.

Per-phase PR creation, merging, or review-request = **Critical**. The fix is to remove the per-phase PR prose and move it (if needed) into a single `Release` section at the bottom of the plan.

### 11. Status conventions

- [ ] Every `### Phase <N>:` heading ends with one of `⏳ 🚧 ✅ ❌` as the last token on the line (separated from the phase name by exactly one space)
- [ ] No raw text like "Pending" / "Done" instead of emoji on the heading

Mixed conventions = **Suggestion**. Missing heading emoji = **Important**.

Per-bullet checkbox well-formedness is **not audited** (v0.3.2+). Plain `- ` bullets are canonical; legacy `- [ ]`/`- [x]` shapes pass through silently.

### 12. No tables for phases / questions (v0.3.0+)

Implementation Phases, Open Questions, and Resolved Questions must use the v0.3.0 list shape — not markdown tables.

- [ ] Implementation Phases uses `### Phase <N>: <name> <emoji>` H3 headings with `- ` bulleted scope items (v0.3.2+; legacy `- [ ]`/`- [x]` accepted silently), **not** a `| Phase | Name | Status | Scope |` markdown table
- [ ] Open Questions uses bulleted `- **Q<N> — <question>:** ...` lines, **not** a `| Q | Blocking? |` table
- [ ] Resolved Questions uses bulleted `- **Q<N> — <question>:** <resolution>` lines, **not** a `| Q | Resolution |` table

Any of these three sections rendered as a markdown table (i.e., a header row with `|` delimiters) = **Critical**, pointing the user at `planning-tools:master-plan-methodology` for the v0.3.0 shape.

**Narrow-cell tables elsewhere in the plan** (Architecture matrices, Code Changes file × phase, Dependency tables, Cost summaries, etc.) are explicitly **allowed** and do not trigger this finding. The ban is scoped to wide-cell sections only.

### 13. Reference naming (v0.3.4+)

Every external reference must carry its **human name** alongside its ID, so a reader never has to leave the plan to find out what `CI-21` is. The rule is owned by `planning-tools:plain-language`.

- [ ] Tickets appear as `<ID> — <title>` (e.g. `CI-21 — Add keyboard navigation`), not as a bare `CI-21`
- [ ] ADRs appear as `ADR-<NN>: <title>` (e.g. `ADR-28: Session error taxonomy`), not as a bare `ADR-28`
- [ ] Pull requests appear as `PR #<N> — <title>`, not as a bare `#412`
- [ ] Where a title genuinely could not be fetched, the plan says so explicitly (`CI-21 — (title unavailable)`) rather than emitting a bare ID

The rule applies to the **first mention in each block**, not once per document — a reader who jumps straight to Phase 5 must still see the name there. Repeating the name across sections is correct, not redundant.

A bare ID = **Suggestion**. Never Important, never Critical, and it never affects the PASS/FAIL verdict. This is a readability nudge; flagging it harder would create the noise the plugin deliberately avoids.

**Not audited:** the plain-language *writing* rules in `planning-tools:plain-language`. Those govern what commands print into the conversation, not the plan document. Plans stay detailed — do not flag a plan for being thorough.

## Report format

The verifier emits findings in this exact shape:

```markdown
# Verification Report: <plan filename>

> Verified: <date>
> Plan path: <path>

## Critical findings

### <#>: <Short title>
- **Location:** <file>:<line>
- **Rule violated:** <which audit dimension>
- **Quote:** <verbatim excerpt>
- **Fix:** <concrete fix>

## Important findings

### <#>: <Short title>
- **Location:** <file>:<line>
- **Rule:** <dimension>
- **Why:** <impact>
- **Fix:** <concrete fix>

## Suggestions

### <#>: <Short title>
- **Location:** <file>:<line>
- **Note:** <polish improvement>

## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| Critical | <n> |
| Important | <n> |
| Suggestion | <n> |

**Verdict:**
- `PASS` — zero Critical, ≤ 2 Important. Safe to append the Verified marker to the context block — a `- **Verified:** <date>` bullet (v0.3.3+), or a `> **Verified:** <date>` line on a legacy blockquote plan.
- `FAIL` — any Critical or > 2 Important. Plan must be revised.

**Top 3 highest-impact fixes:**
1. …
2. …
3. …
```

## Mandatory Use of AskUserQuestion

The verifier agent does **not** call `AskUserQuestion` — it emits the report only. The main conversation (in `/planning-tools:plan-verify`) presents the report and calls `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user whether to append the Verified marker to the context block when the verdict is `PASS` — a `- **Verified:** YYYY-MM-DD` bullet (v0.3.3+), or a `> **Verified:** YYYY-MM-DD` line on a legacy blockquote plan.
