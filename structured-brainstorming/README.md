# structured-brainstorming

Structured thinking methods that counteract LLM reasoning biases during problem exploration. Gives Claude 8 specific methods — selected because they fight known failure modes like premature convergence, sycophancy, and mode collapse. The user decides when to dispatch parallel subagents that explore the problem from different angles simultaneously.

## The Problem

Without deliberate structure, LLM responses gravitate toward the most probable answer, skip genuine alternative exploration, and converge prematurely on conventional solutions. This plugin provides methods that force deeper, more diverse thinking.

## The 8 Methods

| Method | Fights | Core Question |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| First Principles Decomposition | Shallow exploration | "What is actually true vs. assumed?" |
| Inversion / Pre-Mortem | Sycophancy | "What would make this fail?" |
| Constraint Manipulation | Mode collapse | "What if I change a constraint?" |
| Perspective Forcing | Single perspective | "How does each stakeholder see this?" |
| Analogy Search | Local search | "Where was this solved in another domain?" |
| MECE Decomposition | Vague decomposition | "What are the non-overlapping parts?" |
| Assumption Surfacing | Authority bias | "What am I taking for granted?" |
| Diverge-then-Converge | Premature convergence | "How many options exist before I evaluate?" |

## Usage

### Automatic Skill Activation

The skill activates when Claude detects relevant work: "how should I approach this?", "I'm stuck on X", "what are my options?", "help me think through this." A `UserPromptSubmit` hook reinforces detection for brainstorming-related prompts.

### Command

```
/brainstorm "How should we design the auth system for our SaaS product?"
```

The `/brainstorm` command follows an interactive flow:

1. **Problem restatement** — Claude restates the problem for confirmation
2. **Dispatch or rephrase** — the user chooses to launch parallel agents or refine the problem statement first
3. **Parallel exploration** — 4 `brainstorm-explorer` agents apply different methods simultaneously
4. **Synthesis** — convergence, disagreement, surprises, recommendation, open questions
5. **Next steps** — explore deeper, brainstorm a different angle, or done

### Parallel Subagent Exploration

When the user chooses to dispatch, `brainstorm-explorer` subagents are spawned in parallel — each applying different methods to the same problem. Agents can search the codebase and the web for cross-domain analogies. The model selects which methods to assign to each agent, maximizing exploration variance.
